### My name's Lane, I am a Programmer and a 3D Artist.

I have experience in many programming languages, including CG (HLSL) for creating shaders in Unity. I enjoy developing tools that makes my job as an artist easier. 

An example of a tool I've created is my Unity Runtime Animation Tester. I developed the tool because I wanted a very fast way to see how my animations look in game.

Programming Proficiency:
* C#
* Java
* Python
* GML
* HLSL (CG)
* HTML
* SQL
* Turing
* Visual Basic 6
