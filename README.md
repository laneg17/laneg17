### My name's Lane, I am a Game Developer and a 3D Artist.

I have experience in several programming languages, including C#, Java and Python. I enjoy developing tools that makes my job as an artist easier. 

An example of a tool I've created is my Unity Camera Switcher. I developed the tool because I wanted a quick way to incorporate cameras into animations/cutscenes in Unity.
